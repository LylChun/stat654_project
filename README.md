## Data
Because of the size of the data, the raw dataset is not hosted here. Instead, we invite you to download from the (original repository)[https://zenodo.org/records/7831751].

The out of sample (OOS) test set is relatively small, so it is included here as a zip file (OOS_test.zip) Images in this folder have been collected from (this IEEE benchmark paper)[videos.https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6004883]. The OOS also contains some images cropped from UK driving videos on youtube.
