# Overview
This repository contains material related to group 15 STAT654 Spring 2025 final project.

Group members: Elizabeth Chun and Sophia Lazcano

## Files
Our project was written in python using jupyter notebooks. These notebook were used for exploration, training, and/or testing.

* cnn_basic_training: trains a basic CNN model with no augmentation on the Primary Dataset
* cnn_basic_testing: tests the basic CNN model on OOS data

## Data
Because of the size of the data, the raw dataset is not hosted here. Instead, we invite you to download from the [original repository](https://zenodo.org/records/7831751).

The out of sample (OOS) test set is relatively small, so it is included here as a zip file (OOS_test.zip) Images in this folder have been collected from [this IEEE benchmark paper](videos.https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6004883). The OOS also contains some images cropped from UK driving videos on youtube.
